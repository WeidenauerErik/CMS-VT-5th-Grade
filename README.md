# CMS classwork – 5th Grade

Welcome to my CMS classwork project from 5th grade!  
This repository contains the code I wrote back then as part of a school assignment. 😊

## About the Project
This project is based on (and forked from) the **symfony-docker** repository.  
It served as an introduction to working with Symfony, Docker, and basic CMS concepts.

## Getting Started
To start the project locally, run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
